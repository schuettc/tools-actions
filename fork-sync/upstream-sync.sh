# Canonical fork-sync script for @schuettc/* republished forks.
# Source of truth: schuettc/tools-actions/fork-sync/upstream-sync.sh. Forks never
# carry a copy: the fork-sync composite action (fork-sync/action.yml) runs it from
# $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH, and per-fork settings live only in the caller's `with:`.
# Operating the forks: schuettc/tools-actions/fork-sync/RUNBOOK.md.
#
# Model (see schuettc/tools-actions/fork-sync/README.md):
#   - schuettc-publish = upstream + genuine source patches + this CI. It never
#     carries packaging metadata (scoped name, -schuettc.N version, repo URLs).
#   - Daily: rebase onto upstream. Clean -> stamp metadata into an isolated copy
#     of the package, publish via npm OIDC trusted publishing (provenance), push
#     the rebased branch + a tag. Conflict or any other failure -> open (or reuse)
#     a tracking issue that @mentions the owner, and fail the run.
#
# Required env (set by fork-sync/action.yml from its inputs):
#   UPSTREAM_REPO    owner/name of the upstream repo
#   UPSTREAM_BRANCH  upstream branch to track (main, master, ...)
#   PKG_NAME         published name, e.g. @schuettc/pi-claude-bridge
#   PKG_DIR          package directory relative to the repo root ("." for root)
#   TAG_PREFIX       git tag prefix for releases, e.g. "v" or "pi-auto-review-v"
# Optional env:
#   TEST_CMD         command run (repo root) after the rebase, before anything is published.
#                    Must install its own deps. Failure = issue + no publish. A clean rebase
#                    is not proof our patches still work; this is.
#   BUILD_CMD        command run (repo root) before packing, when the package ships built output.
#                    The isolated copy is published with --ignore-scripts, so any build the
#                    package's own prepack/prepublishOnly would do MUST happen here.
#   FORCE            "true" publishes even when already in sync
#   DRY_RUN          "true" runs everything (rebase, test, build, stamp, npm pack) but never
#                    publishes, pushes, tags, or files issues. Proves the pipeline end to end.
#   NOTIFY_TEST      "true" opens + closes a test issue to prove notifications, then exits
# Provided by Actions: GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER, GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_RUN_ID, GH_TOKEN

# stamp_package <package.json>: write the published name, -schuettc.N version

# and schuettc/tools-actions/fork-sync/first-publish.sh reaches it through
# `upstream-sync.sh --stamp <package.json>`, so a first publish is stamped
# exactly the way CI stamps.
